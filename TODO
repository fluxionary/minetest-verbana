create a way to search for players by IP/net instead of just ASN

a command to *list* alts...
incorporate alt status/connection logs into results...

remaining commands to be tested:
- ip_suspect
- ip_unsuspect
- ip_block
- ip_unblock
- asn_block
- asn_unblock

DOCUMENTATION....


alert staff if there are new reports since their last login

a way to resolve reports?

make settings for the hard-coded values for report rate limiting
