rework /ban_record
- make it a summary of whether a player might be suspicious based on known associations
- like sban's ban record
- function currently named ban_record would be renamed "record"
- "so you want to specify his name, and see a list of banned/troublesome accounts from his ASN."
- "so with one command, I should see, perhaps, IP-linked accounts, first and last login, ban record, and flagged accounts sharing their asn"

create a way to search for players by IP/net instead of just ASN

make way to show last login IP on certain commands (e.g. /inspect_asn)

make settings for the hard-coded values for reporting timing

alert staff if there are new reports since their last login

a way to resolve reports?
